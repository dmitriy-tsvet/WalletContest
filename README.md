Greetings! I am glad to take part in such a competition and become part of this community.

I am an active @wallet user and want to participate in the development of this project.

### About yourself:

Dmitry, 20 years old, Moscow.

I am a full stack telegram web apps developer with 3 years of experience. I decided to try myself as a designer (it was not easy).

* Telegram: @mainbatya
* Website: https://smithdevelopers.ru

### Now to my concept:

My main idea was to present the user with an interface with which he is familiar - a banking application.

* I made only one version mainly for iOS. Telegram design also adheres to this version more.

* If some pages are missing, it means I decided that the current design decisions are good.


`Home/home_1.png` — I've completely decided to rethink the main screen and my main change is in the interface. This version with this is a version where the user is just learning about the wallet and does not have Ton Space.

**Main buttons** provide access to the main services of the app:
* **Scan QR** — functionally this is the current design button on the top right. (On PC version hide)
* **TON Space** — go to TON Space wallet.
* **P2P Trade** — go to P2P trading. I didn’t touch this module completely, because I think it’s very worthy at the moment.
* **Settings** — go to main settings. I didn’t touch this module also.
* **History transactions** — one of my main features of the new design

`Home/home_2.png` — page without banners and active TON Space. I don’t know how technically difficult it would be to display TON Space tokens like this, but I see it this way and I really like it.

`Home/video.MP4` — a short video that I made by inserting a picture into a web app, initially I wanted to make a completely separate web application for a new design, but I did not have enough time.

`Currencies/currencies.png` — if you click **History transactions** or **View All** on home page.
`Currencies/currency_page_1.png` — if you click **USDT** in list currencies or on home page.

`Currencies/exchange.png` — this is a rethinking of the exchange, I even created my own test design group and compared it with the current one in the wallet, opinions differed greatly, I even thought not to show it, but still.
`Currencies/receive.png` — this is a rethinking of the receive cryptocurrency.

`Currencies/send/*` — send currency to other wallet.

`Transaction History/*` — new vision of transaction history, with stats, and filters for sorting.
Sorting filters:
* **Type**: Withdraw, Top-up, Exchange
* **Currency**: USDT, BTC...
* **Amount**: 1000 - 2000 USDT
* **Time**: 10:00-19:00

Once again I want to thank you for this opportunity to participate. I would like more competitions like this, not only from the Wallet team and from Telegram in general, for example, in the fall I took part in a web app development competition and missed the deadline, but I finished the application)
