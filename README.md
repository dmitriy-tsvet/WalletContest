Greetings! I am glad to take part in such a competition and become part of this community.

I am an active @wallet user and want to participate in the development of this project.

### About yourself:

Dmitry, 20 years old, Moscow.

I am a full stack telegram web apps developer with 3 years of experience. I decided to try myself as a designer (it was not easy).

* Telegram: @mainbatya
* Website: https://smithdevelopers.ru

### Now to my concept:

My main idea was to present the user with an interface with which he is familiar - a banking application.

I made only one version mainly for iOS. Telegram design also adheres to this version more.

If some pages are missing, it means I decided that the current design decisions are good.

Each folder contains a file with a description of the txt file and page.
